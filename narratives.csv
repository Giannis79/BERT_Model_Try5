Men and women our defenders. You are brilliantly defending the country from one of the most powerful countries in the world. Today Russia attacked the entire territory of our state. And today our defenders have done a lot. They defended almost the entire territory of Ukraine which suffered direct blows. They regain the one that the enemy managed to occupy. For example Hostomel near Kyiv. This gives more confidence to the capital. According to preliminary data unfortunately we have lost 137 of our heroes today - our citizens. 10 of them are officers. 316 are wounded. On our Zmiinyi Island defending it to the last all the border guards died heroically. But did not give up. All of them will be posthumously awarded the title of Hero of Ukraine. May the memory of those who gave their lives for Ukraine live forever. I am grateful to everyone who saves people right now and helps maintain order in the state. The enemy strikes not only at military facilities as it claims but also at civilians. They kill people and turn peaceful cities into military targets. This is vile and will never be forgiven. I know that a lot of fakes are being produced now. In particular that I allegedly left Kyiv. I stay in the capital I stay with my people. During the day I held dozens of international talks directly managed our country. And I will stay in the capital. My family is also in Ukraine. My children are also in Ukraine. My family is not traitors. They are the citizens of Ukraine. But I have no right to say where they are now. According to our information the enemy marked me as the number one target. My family is the number two target. They want to destroy Ukraine politically by destroying the Head of State. We also have information that enemy sabotage groups have entered Kyiv. That's why I am asking Kyivites very much: be careful follow the rules of curfew. I remain in the government quarter together with all those who are necessary for the work of the central government. No matter how many conversations I had with the leaders of different countries today I heard a few things. The first is that we are supported. And I am grateful to each state that helps Ukraine concretely not just in words. But there is another - we are left alone in defense of our state. Who is ready to fight with us? Honestly - I do not see such. Who is ready to guarantee Ukraine's accession to NATO? Honestly everyone is afraid. Today we heard from Moscow that they still want to talk. They want to talk about Ukraine's neutral status. I tell all the partners of our state: now is an important moment - the fate of our country is being decided. I ask them: are you with us? They answer that they are with us. But they are not ready to take us to the Alliance. Today I asked the twenty-seven leaders of Europe whether Ukraine will be in NATO. I asked directly. Everyone is afraid. They do not answer. And we are not afraid of anything. We are not afraid to defend our state. We are not afraid of Russia. We are not afraid to talk to Russia. We are not afraid to say everything about security guarantees for our state. We are not afraid to talk about neutral status. We are not in NATO now. But the main thing - what security guarantees will we have? And what specific countries will give them? We need to talk about the end of this invasion. We need to talk about a ceasefire. But now the fate of the country depends entirely on our army on our heroes our security forces all our defenders. And on our people your wisdom and the great support of all friends of our country. Glory to Ukraine.,Pro-Ukrainian,Multiple,Speech
Great people of a great country! A country of power. A country of freedom. The people of absolute moral leadership. We have endured nine days of darkness. Nine days of evil. This is three times more than darkness and evil expected. We responded to the invasion as we can in times of greatest danger. Responded with heroism. Solidarity. Mutual assistance. We responded in Ukrainian. So that the history of Europe will remember it forever. It will tell children about it. Show it to grandchildren. The whole continent will know the city of Kharkiv. The city of Chernihiv. The city of Sumy. The city of Volnovakha. The city of Mariupol. The city of Mykolaiv. And many other of our beautiful cities. Living cities! Cities that have withstood the worst invasion since World War II. I say this specifically as a fait accompli. Withstood. No matter what the situation is at the moment strategically everything is clear. Ukrainians are united from Uzhhorod to Kharkiv from Kyiv to Kherson. Ukrainians are chasing the enemy near Kyiv. They are beating him for Okhtyrka. Punishing him for Hostomel. They will take revenge for Kherson. Our Kherson! Ukrainian Kherson. Which they tried to humiliate today. They failed. They were not allowed. Ukrainians have shown themselves. They did not allow themselves to be deceived in a cheap cynical show. With a handout instead of help. With propaganda instead of sincerity. Russian propagandists thought of our people as of themselves. And they saw that Kherson residents are proud. And respect themselves. Respect Ukraine. I understand how difficult the decision is. When in the occupation they come out against armed enemies. I feel how risky it is. But I see how our people refuse to play by the rules of the invaders. How our people remain Ukrainians. How our people stay with our state even temporarily finding themselves in the darkness. If Russian politicians still have their eyes they will be able to see what Ukraine is. What our freedom is. The invaders thought they could turn off our television to Ukrainians. Our connection. They thought they could take away products shut off the electricity. They thought it would force Ukrainians to submit. But even if you deprive us of oxygen we will breathe deeply to say: get out of our land! Even in complete darkness we see the truth. And we will fight until it darkens in our eyes. Because we are the warriors of light. And today no one on Earth will be able to say that this line is pathos. The 9th day of the war. Many of us have a tradition to remember those who are not with us on the 9th day. Eternal memory to everyone who died for Ukraine! Unfortunately today there is a complete impression that it is time to give a funeral repast for something else: Security guarantees and promises. Determination of alliances. Values that seem to be dead for someone. The NATO summit took place today. Weak summit. Confused summit. Summit which shows that not everyone considers the struggle for freedom to be Europe's number one goal. All NATO intelligence offices are well aware of the enemy's plans. They also confirmed that Russia wants to continue the offensive. As best it can. For 9 days we have seen a brutal war. They are destroying our cities. They are shelling our people our children and residential neighborhoods. Churches. Schools. They destroy everything that ensures a normal life. And they want to continue it. Knowing that new strikes and casualties are inevitable NATO deliberately decided NOT to close the sky over Ukraine. We believe that NATO countries themselves have created a narrative that the closure of the sky over Ukraine would provoke Russia's direct aggression against NATO. This is self-hypnosis. Of those who are weak underconfident. Internally. Although they may have weapons many times more powerful than ours. You had to think about people. About humanity itself. And what did you think about at that summit? All the people who will die starting from this day will also die because of you. Because of your weakness. Because of your disunity. All the Alliance has managed to do so far is to carry fifty tons of diesel fuel for Ukraine through its procurement system. Probably so that we can burn the Budapest Memorandum. To make it burn better. But it is already burnt for us. In the fire of Russian troops. Is this NATO we wanted? Is this the Alliance you were building? Today the Alliance's leadership gave the green light for further bombing of Ukrainian cities by refusing to make a no-fly zone.You could close our sky. But… I do not know who you can protect and whether you can protect NATO countries. You will not be able to buy us off with liters of fuel for liters of our blood. Shed for our common Europe. For our common freedom. For our common future. But I am also grateful to our country's friends in NATO. There are many countries of our friends our partners - most of the powerful partners. Those who help our state no matter what. From the first day of the invasion. And I'm sure until the victory. And that's why we do NOT feel alone. We continue to fight. We will protect our state. We will liberate our land. Thanks to our heroes. I awarded decorations and medals to 76 Ukrainian heroes for personal courage and selfless actions for our defense. Unfortunately 37 of them are awarded posthumously. I awarded the title of Hero of Ukraine to Lieutenant General Oleksandr Oleksiyovych Pavliuk Commander of the Joint Forces Operation. I conferred the military rank of Brigadier General on Colonel Volodymyr Vasyliovych Shvorak Deputy Commander of the East Operational Command of the Land Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. I conferred the military rank of Brigadier General of Justice on Colonel of Justice Serhiy Mykolayovych Melnyk Head of the Military Law Institute of the Yaroslav the Wise National Law University. I conferred the military rank of Brigadier General on Colonel Artem Yevhenovych Bohomolov Deputy Commander of the West Operational Command. I conferred the military rank of General on Valerii Fedorovych Zaluzhnyi Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Glory to Ukraine!,Pro-Ukrainian,Multiple,Speech
"I consider it necessary today to speak again about the tragic events in Donbass and the key aspects of ensuring the security of Russia. I will begin with what I said in my address on February 21 2022. I spoke about our biggest concerns and worries and about the fundamental threats which irresponsible Western politicians created for Russia consistently rudely and unceremoniously from year to year. I am referring to the eastward expansion of NATO which is moving its military infrastructure ever closer to the Russian border. It is a fact that over the past 30 years we have been patiently trying to come to an agreement with the leading NATO countries regarding the principles of equal and indivisible security in Europe. In response to our proposals we invariably faced either cynical deception and lies or attempts at pressure and blackmail while the North Atlantic alliance continued to expand despite our protests and concerns. Its military machine is moving and as I said is approaching our very border. Why is this happening? Where did this insolent manner of talking down from the height of their exceptionalism infallibility and all-permissiveness come from? What is the explanation for this contemptuous and disdainful attitude to our interests and absolutely legitimate demands? The answer is simple. Everything is clear and obvious. In the late 1980s the Soviet Union grew weaker and subsequently broke apart. That experience should serve as a good lesson for us because it has shown us that the paralysis of power and will is the first step towards complete degradation and oblivion. We lost confidence for only one moment but it was enough to disrupt the balance of forces in the world. As a result the old treaties and agreements are no longer effective. Entreaties and requests do not help. Anything that does not suit the dominant state the powers that be is denounced as archaic obsolete and useless. At the same time everything it regards as useful is presented as the ultimate truth and forced on others regardless of the cost abusively and by any means available. Those who refuse to comply are subjected to strong-arm tactics. What I am saying now does not concerns only Russia and Russia is not the only country that is worried about this. This has to do with the entire system of international relations and sometimes even US allies. The collapse of the Soviet Union led to a redivision of the world and the norms of international law that developed by that time – and the most important of them the fundamental norms that were adopted following WWII and largely formalised its outcome – came in the way of those who declared themselves the winners of the Cold War. Of course practice international relations and the rules regulating them had to take into account the changes that took place in the world and in the balance of forces. However this should have been done professionally smoothly patiently and with due regard and respect for the interests of all states and one’s own responsibility. Instead we saw a state of euphoria created by the feeling of absolute superiority a kind of modern absolutism coupled with the low cultural standards and arrogance of those who formulated and pushed through decisions that suited only themselves. The situation took a different turn. There are many examples of this. First a bloody military operation was waged against Belgrade without the UN Security Council’s sanction but with combat aircraft and missiles used in the heart of Europe. The bombing of peaceful cities and vital infrastructure went on for several weeks. I have to recall these facts because some Western colleagues prefer to forget them and when we mentioned the event they prefer to avoid speaking about international law instead emphasising the circumstances which they interpret as they think necessary. Then came the turn of Iraq Libya and Syria. The illegal use of military power against Libya and the distortion of all the UN Security Council decisions on Libya ruined the state created a huge seat of international terrorism and pushed the country towards a humanitarian catastrophe into the vortex of a civil war which has continued there for years. The tragedy which was created for hundreds of thousands and even millions of people not only in Libya but in the whole region has led to a large-scale exodus from the Middle East and North Africa to Europe. A similar fate was also prepared for Syria. The combat operations conducted by the Western coalition in that country without the Syrian government’s approval or UN Security Council’s sanction can only be defined as aggression and intervention. But the example that stands apart from the above events is of course the invasion of Iraq without any legal grounds. They used the pretext of allegedly reliable information available in the United States about the presence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. To prove that allegation the US Secretary of State held up a vial with white power publicly for the whole world to see assuring the international community that it was a chemical warfare agent created in Iraq. It later turned out that all of that was a fake and a sham and that Iraq did not have any chemical weapons. Incredible and shocking but true. We witnessed lies made at the highest state level and voiced from the high UN rostrum. As a result we see a tremendous loss in human life damage destruction and a colossal upsurge of terrorism. Overall it appears that nearly everywhere in many regions of the world where the United States brought its law and order this created bloody non-healing wounds and the curse of international terrorism and extremism. I have only mentioned the most glaring but far from only examples of disregard for international law. This array includes promises not to expand NATO eastwards even by an inch. To reiterate: they have deceived us or to put it simply they have played us. Sure one often hears that politics is a dirty business. It could be but it shouldn’t be as dirty as it is now not to such an extent. This type of con-artist behaviour is contrary not only to the principles of international relations but also and above all to the generally accepted norms of morality and ethics. Where is justice and truth here? Just lies and hypocrisy all around. Incidentally US politicians political scientists and journalists write and say that a veritable “empire of lies” has been created inside the United States in recent years. It is hard to disagree with this – it is really so. But one should not be modest about it: the United States is still a great country and a system-forming power. All its satellites not only humbly and obediently say yes to and parrot it at the slightest pretext but also imitate its behaviour and enthusiastically accept the rules it is offering them. Therefore one can say with good reason and confidence that the whole so-called Western bloc formed by the United States in its own image and likeness is in its entirety the very same “empire of lies.” As for our country after the disintegration of the USSR given the entire unprecedented openness of the new modern Russia its readiness to work honestly with the United States and other Western partners and its practically unilateral disarmament they immediately tried to put the final squeeze on us finish us off and utterly destroy us. This is how it was in the 1990s and the early 2000s when the so-called collective West was actively supporting separatism and gangs of mercenaries in southern Russia. What victims what losses we had to sustain and what trials we had to go through at that time before we broke the back of international terrorism in the Caucasus! We remember this and will never forget. Properly speaking the attempts to use us in their own interests never ceased until quite recently: they sought to destroy our traditional values and force on us their false values that would erode us our people from within the attitudes they have been aggressively imposing on their countries attitudes that are directly leading to degradation and degeneration because they are contrary to human nature. This is not going to happen. No one has ever succeeded in doing this nor will they succeed now. Despite all that in December 2021 we made yet another attempt to reach agreement with the United States and its allies on the principles of European security and NATO’s non-expansion. Our efforts were in vain. The United States has not changed its position. It does not believe it necessary to agree with Russia on a matter that is critical for us. The United States is pursuing its own objectives while neglecting our interests. Of course this situation begs a question: what next what are we to expect? If history is any guide we know that in 1940 and early 1941 the Soviet Union went to great lengths to prevent war or at least delay its outbreak. To this end the USSR sought not to provoke the potential aggressor until the very end by refraining or postponing the most urgent and obvious preparations it had to make to defend itself from an imminent attack. When it finally acted it was too late. As a result the country was not prepared to counter the invasion by Nazi Germany which attacked our Motherland on June 22 1941 without declaring war. The country stopped the enemy and went on to defeat it but this came at a tremendous cost. The attempt to appease the aggressor ahead of the Great Patriotic War proved to be a mistake which came at a high cost for our people. In the first months after the hostilities broke out we lost vast territories of strategic importance as well as millions of lives. We will not make this mistake the second time. We have no right to do so. Those who aspire to global dominance have publicly designated Russia as their enemy. They did so with impunity. Make no mistake they had no reason to act this way. It is true that they have considerable financial scientific technological and military capabilities. We are aware of this and have an objective view of the economic threats we have been hearing just as our ability to counter this brash and never-ending blackmail. Let me reiterate that we have no illusions in this regard and are extremely realistic in our assessments. As for military affairs even after the dissolution of the USSR and losing a considerable part of its capabilities today’s Russia remains one of the most powerful nuclear states. Moreover it has a certain advantage in several cutting-edge weapons. In this context there should be no doubt for anyone that any potential aggressor will face defeat and ominous consequences should it directly attack our country. At the same time technology including in the defence sector is changing rapidly. One day there is one leader and tomorrow another but a military presence in territories bordering on Russia if we permit it to go ahead will stay for decades to come or maybe forever creating an ever mounting and totally unacceptable threat for Russia. Even now with NATO’s eastward expansion the situation for Russia has been becoming worse and more dangerous by the year. Moreover these past days NATO leadership has been blunt in its statements that they need to accelerate and step up efforts to bring the alliance’s infrastructure closer to Russia’s borders. In other words they have been toughening their position. We cannot stay idle and passively observe these developments. This would be an absolutely irresponsible thing to do for us. Any further expansion of the North Atlantic alliance’s infrastructure or the ongoing efforts to gain a military foothold of the Ukrainian territory are unacceptable for us. Of course the question is not about NATO itself. It merely serves as a tool of US foreign policy. The problem is that in territories adjacent to Russia which I have to note is our historical land a hostile “anti-Russia” is taking shape. Fully controlled from the outside it is doing everything to attract NATO armed forces and obtain cutting-edge weapons. For the United States and its allies it is a policy of containing Russia with obvious geopolitical dividends. For our country it is a matter of life and death a matter of our historical future as a nation. This is not an exaggeration; this is a fact. It is not only a very real threat to our interests but to the very existence of our state and to its sovereignty. It is the red line which we have spoken about on numerous occasions. They have crossed it. This brings me to the situation in Donbass. We can see that the forces that staged the coup in Ukraine in 2014 have seized power are keeping it with the help of ornamental election procedures and have abandoned the path of a peaceful conflict settlement. For eight years for eight endless years we have been doing everything possible to settle the situation by peaceful political means. Everything was in vain. As I said in my previous address you cannot look without compassion at what is happening there. It became impossible to tolerate it. We had to stop that atrocity that genocide of the millions of people who live there and who pinned their hopes on Russia on all of us. It is their aspirations the feelings and pain of these people that were the main motivating force behind our decision to recognise the independence of the Donbass people’s republics. I would like to additionally emphasise the following. Focused on their own goals the leading NATO countries are supporting the far-right nationalists and neo-Nazis in Ukraine those who will never forgive the people of Crimea and Sevastopol for freely making a choice to reunite with Russia. They will undoubtedly try to bring war to Crimea just as they have done in Donbass to kill innocent people just as members of the punitive units of Ukrainian nationalists and Hitler’s accomplices did during the Great Patriotic War. They have also openly laid claim to several other Russian regions. If we look at the sequence of events and the incoming reports the showdown between Russia and these forces cannot be avoided. It is only a matter of time. They are getting ready and waiting for the right moment. Moreover they went as far as aspire to acquire nuclear weapons. We will not let this happen. I have already said that Russia accepted the new geopolitical reality after the dissolution of the USSR. We have been treating all new post-Soviet states with respect and will continue to act this way. We respect and will respect their sovereignty as proven by the assistance we provided to Kazakhstan when it faced tragic events and a challenge in terms of its statehood and integrity. However Russia cannot feel safe develop and exist while facing a permanent threat from the territory of today’s Ukraine. Let me remind you that in 2000–2005 we used our military to push back against terrorists in the Caucasus and stood up for the integrity of our state. We preserved Russia. In 2014 we supported the people of Crimea and Sevastopol. In 2015 we used our Armed Forces to create a reliable shield that prevented terrorists from Syria from penetrating Russia. This was a matter of defending ourselves. We had no other choice. The same is happening today. They did not leave us any other option for defending Russia and our people other than the one we are forced to use today. In these circumstances we have to take bold and immediate action. The people’s republics of Donbass have asked Russia for help. In this context in accordance with Article 51 (Chapter VII) of the UN Charter with permission of Russia’s Federation Council and in execution of the treaties of friendship and mutual assistance with the Donetsk People’s Republic and the Lugansk People’s Republic ratified by the Federal Assembly on February 22 I made a decision to carry out a special military operation. The purpose of this operation is to protect people who for eight years now have been facing humiliation and genocide perpetrated by the Kiev regime. To this end we will seek to demilitarise and denazify Ukraine as well as bring to trial those who perpetrated numerous bloody crimes against civilians including against citizens of the Russian Federation. It is not our plan to occupy the Ukrainian territory. We do not intend to impose anything on anyone by force. At the same time we have been hearing an increasing number of statements coming from the West that there is no need any more to abide by the documents setting forth the outcomes of World War II as signed by the totalitarian Soviet regime. How can we respond to that? The outcomes of World War II and the sacrifices our people had to make to defeat Nazism are sacred. This does not contradict the high values of human rights and freedoms in the reality that emerged over the post-war decades. This does not mean that nations cannot enjoy the right to self-determination which is enshrined in Article 1 of the UN Charter. Let me remind you that the people living in territories which are part of today’s Ukraine were not asked how they want to build their lives when the USSR was created or after World War II. Freedom guides our policy the freedom to choose independently our future and the future of our children. We believe that all the peoples living in today’s Ukraine anyone who want to do this must be able to enjoy this right to make a free choice. In this context I would like to address the citizens of Ukraine. In 2014 Russia was obliged to protect the people of Crimea and Sevastopol from those who you yourself call “nats.” The people of Crimea and Sevastopol made their choice in favour of being with their historical homeland Russia and we supported their choice. As I said we could not act otherwise. The current events have nothing to do with a desire to infringe on the interests of Ukraine and the Ukrainian people. They are connected with the defending Russia from those who have taken Ukraine hostage and are trying to use it against our country and our people. I reiterate: we are acting to defend ourselves from the threats created for us and from a worse peril than what is happening now. I am asking you however hard this may be to understand this and to work together with us so as to turn this tragic page as soon as possible and to move forward together without allowing anyone to interfere in our affairs and our relations but developing them independently so as to create favourable conditions for overcoming all these problems and to strengthen us from within as a single whole despite the existence of state borders. I believe in this in our common future. I would also like to address the military personnel of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. Comrade officers Your fathers grandfathers and great-grandfathers did not fight the Nazi occupiers and did not defend our common Motherland to allow today’s neo-Nazis to seize power in Ukraine. You swore the oath of allegiance to the Ukrainian people and not to the junta the people’s adversary which is plundering Ukraine and humiliating the Ukrainian people. I urge you to refuse to carry out their criminal orders. I urge you to immediately lay down arms and go home. I will explain what this means: the military personnel of the Ukrainian army who do this will be able to freely leave the zone of hostilities and return to their families. I want to emphasise again that all responsibility for the possible bloodshed will lie fully and wholly with the ruling Ukrainian regime. I would now like to say something very important for those who may be tempted to interfere in these developments from the outside. No matter who tries to stand in our way or all the more so create threats for our country and our people they must know that Russia will respond immediately and the consequences will be such as you have never seen in your entire history. No matter how the events unfold we are ready. All the necessary decisions in this regard have been taken. I hope that my words will be heard. Citizens of Russia The culture and values experience and traditions of our ancestors invariably provided a powerful underpinning for the wellbeing and the very existence of entire states and nations their success and viability. Of course this directly depends on the ability to quickly adapt to constant change maintain social cohesion and readiness to consolidate and summon all the available forces in order to move forward. We always need to be strong but this strength can take on different forms. The “empire of lies” which I mentioned in the beginning of my speech proceeds in its policy primarily from rough direct force. This is when our saying on being “all brawn and no brains” applies. We all know that having justice and truth on our side is what makes us truly strong. If this is the case it would be hard to disagree with the fact that it is our strength and our readiness to fight that are the bedrock of independence and sovereignty and provide the necessary foundation for building a reliable future for your home your family and your Motherland. Dear compatriots I am certain that devoted soldiers and officers of Russia’s Armed Forces will perform their duty with professionalism and courage. I have no doubt that the government institutions at all levels and specialists will work effectively to guarantee the stability of our economy financial system and social wellbeing and the same applies to corporate executives and the entire business community. I hope that all parliamentary parties and civil society take a consolidated patriotic position. At the end of the day the future of Russia is in the hands of its multi-ethnic people as has always been the case in our history. This means that the decisions that I made will be executed that we will achieve the goals we have set and reliably guarantee the security of our Motherland. I believe in your support and the invincible force rooted in the love for our Fatherland.,Pro-Russian,Multiple,Speech"
"My address concerns the events in Ukraine and why this is so important for us for Russia. Of course my message is also addressed to our compatriots in Ukraine. The matter is very serious and needs to be discussed in depth. The situation in Donbass has reached a critical acute stage. I am speaking to you directly today not only to explain what is happening but also to inform you of the decisions being made as well as potential further steps. I would like to emphasise again that Ukraine is not just a neighbouring country for us. It is an inalienable part of our own history culture and spiritual space. These are our comrades those dearest to us – not only colleagues friends and people who once served together but also relatives people bound by blood by family ties. Since time immemorial the people living in the south-west of what has historically been Russian land have called themselves Russians and Orthodox Christians. This was the case before the 17th century when a portion of this territory rejoined the Russian state and after. It seems to us that generally speaking we all know these facts that this is common knowledge. Still it is necessary to say at least a few words about the history of this issue in order to understand what is happening today to explain the motives behind Russia’s actions and what we aim to achieve. So I will start with the fact that modern Ukraine was entirely created by Russia or to be more precise by Bolshevik Communist Russia. This process started practically right after the 1917 revolution and Lenin and his associates did it in a way that was extremely harsh on Russia – by separating severing what is historically Russian land. Nobody asked the millions of people living there what they thought. Then both before and after the Great Patriotic War Stalin incorporated in the USSR and transferred to Ukraine some lands that previously belonged to Poland Romania and Hungary. In the process he gave Poland part of what was traditionally German land as compensation and in 1954 Khrushchev took Crimea away from Russia for some reason and also gave it to Ukraine. In effect this is how the territory of modern Ukraine was formed. But now I would like to focus attention on the initial period of the USSR’s formation. I believe this is extremely important for us. I will have to approach it from a distance so to speak. I will remind you that after the 1917 October Revolution and the subsequent Civil War the Bolsheviks set about creating a new statehood. They had rather serious disagreements among themselves on this point. In 1922 Stalin occupied the positions of both the General Secretary of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks) and the People’s Commissar for Ethnic Affairs. He suggested building the country on the principles of autonomisation that is giving the republics – the future administrative and territorial entities – broad powers upon joining a unified state. Lenin criticised this plan and suggested making concessions to the nationalists whom he called “independents” at that time. Lenin’s ideas of what amounted in essence to a confederative state arrangement and a slogan about the right of nations to self-determination up to secession were laid in the foundation of Soviet statehood. Initially they were confirmed in the Declaration on the Formation of the USSR in 1922 and later on after Lenin’s death were enshrined in the 1924 Soviet Constitution. This immediately raises many questions. The first is really the main one: why was it necessary to appease the nationalists to satisfy the ceaselessly growing nationalist ambitions on the outskirts of the former empire? What was the point of transferring to the newly often arbitrarily formed administrative units – the union republics – vast territories that had nothing to do with them? Let me repeat that these territories were transferred along with the population of what was historically Russia. Moreover these administrative units were de facto given the status and form of national state entities. That raises another question: why was it necessary to make such generous gifts beyond the wildest dreams of the most zealous nationalists and on top of all that give the republics the right to secede from the unified state without any conditions? At first glance this looks absolutely incomprehensible even crazy. But only at first glance. There is an explanation. After the revolution the Bolsheviks’ main goal was to stay in power at all costs absolutely at all costs. They did everything for this purpose: accepted the humiliating Treaty of Brest-Litovsk although the military and economic situation in Kaiser Germany and its allies was dramatic and the outcome of the First World War was a foregone conclusion and satisfied any demands and wishes of the nationalists within the country. When it comes to the historical destiny of Russia and its peoples Lenin’s principles of state development were not just a mistake; they were worse than a mistake as the saying goes. This became patently clear after the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991. Of course we cannot change past events but we must at least admit them openly and honestly without any reservations or politicking. Personally I can add that no political factors however impressive or profitable they may seem at any given moment can or may be used as the fundamental principles of statehood. I am not trying to put the blame on anyone. The situation in the country at that time both before and after the Civil War was extremely complicated; it was critical. The only thing I would like to say today is that this is exactly how it was. It is a historical fact. Actually as I have already said Soviet Ukraine is the result of the Bolsheviks’ policy and can be rightfully called “Vladimir Lenin’s Ukraine.” He was its creator and architect. This is fully and comprehensively corroborated by archival documents including Lenin’s harsh instructions regarding Donbass which was actually shoved into Ukraine. And today the “grateful progeny” has overturned monuments to Lenin in Ukraine. They call it decommunization. You want decommunization? Very well this suits us just fine. But why stop halfway? We are ready to show what real decommunizations would mean for Ukraine. Going back to history I would like to repeat that the Soviet Union was established in the place of the former Russian Empire in 1922. But practice showed immediately that it was impossible to preserve or govern such a vast and complex territory on the amorphous principles that amounted to confederation. They were far removed from reality and the historical tradition. It is logical that the Red Terror and a rapid slide into Stalin’s dictatorship the domination of the communist ideology and the Communist Party’s monopoly on power nationalisation and the planned economy – all this transformed the formally declared but ineffective principles of government into a mere declaration. In reality the union republics did not have any sovereign rights none at all. The practical result was the creation of a tightly centralised and absolutely unitary state. In fact what Stalin fully implemented was not Lenin’s but his own principles of government. But he did not make the relevant amendments to the cornerstone documents to the Constitution and he did not formally revise Lenin’s principles underlying the Soviet Union. From the look of it there seemed to be no need for that because everything seemed to be working well in conditions of the totalitarian regime and outwardly it looked wonderful attractive and even super-democratic. And yet it is a great pity that the fundamental and formally legal foundations of our state were not promptly cleansed of the odious and utopian fantasies inspired by the revolution which are absolutely destructive for any normal state. As it often happened in our country before nobody gave any thought to the future. It seems that the Communist Party leaders were convinced that they had created a solid system of government and that their policies had settled the ethnic issue for good. But falsification misconception and tampering with public opinion have a high cost. The virus of nationalist ambitions is still with us and the mine laid at the initial stage to destroy state immunity to the disease of nationalism was ticking. As I have already said the mine was the right of secession from the Soviet Union. In the mid-1980s the increasing socioeconomic problems and the apparent crisis of the planned economy aggravated the ethnic issue which essentially was not based on any expectations or unfulfilled dreams of the Soviet peoples but primarily the growing appetites of the local elites. However instead of analysing the situation taking appropriate measures first of all in the economy and gradually transforming the political system and government in a well-considered and balanced manner the Communist Party leadership only engaged in open doubletalk about the revival of the Leninist principle of national self-determination. Moreover in the course of power struggle within the Communist Party itself each of the opposing sides in a bid to expand its support base started to thoughtlessly incite and encourage nationalist sentiments manipulating them and promising their potential supporters whatever they wished. Against the backdrop of the superficial and populist rhetoric about democracy and a bright future based either on a market or a planned economy but amid a true impoverishment of people and widespread shortages no one among the powers that be was thinking about the inevitable tragic consequences for the country. Next they entirely embarked on the track beaten at the inception of the USSR and pandering to the ambitions of the nationalist elites nurtured within their own party ranks. But in so doing they forgot that the CPSU no longer had – thank God – the tools for retaining power and the country itself tools such as state terror and a Stalinist-type dictatorship and that the notorious guiding role of the party was disappearing without a trace like a morning mist right before their eyes. And then the September 1989 plenary session of the CPSU Central Committee approved a truly fatal document the so-called ethnic policy of the party in modern conditions the CPSU platform. It included the following provisions I quote: “The republics of the USSR shall possess all the rights appropriate to their status as sovereign socialist states.” The next point: “The supreme representative bodies of power of the USSR republics can challenge and suspend the operation of the USSR Government’s resolutions and directives in their territory.” And finally: “Each republic of the USSR shall have citizenship of its own which shall apply to all of its residents.” Wasn’t it clear what these formulas and decisions would lead to? Now is not the time or place to go into matters pertaining to state or constitutional law or define the concept of citizenship. But one may wonder: why was it necessary to rock the country even more in that already complicated situation? The facts remain. Even two years before the collapse of the USSR its fate was actually predetermined. It is now that radicals and nationalists including and primarily those in Ukraine are taking credit for having gained independence. As we can see this is absolutely wrong. The disintegration of our united country was brought about by the historic strategic mistakes on the part of the Bolshevik leaders and the CPSU leadership mistakes committed at different times in state-building and in economic and ethnic policies. The collapse of the historical Russia known as the USSR is on their conscience. Despite all these injustices lies and outright pillage of Russia it was our people who accepted the new geopolitical reality that took shape after the dissolution of the USSR and recognised the new independent states. Not only did Russia recognise these countries but helped its CIS partners even though it faced a very dire situation itself. This included our Ukrainian colleagues who turned to us for financial support many times from the very moment they declared independence. Our country provided this assistance while respecting Ukraine’s dignity and sovereignty. According to expert assessments confirmed by a simple calculation of our energy prices the subsidised loans Russia provided to Ukraine along with economic and trade preferences the overall benefit for the Ukrainian budget in the period from 1991 to 2013 amounted to $250 billion. However there was more to it than that. By the end of 1991 the USSR owed some $100 billion to other countries and international funds. Initially there was this idea that all former Soviet republics will pay back these loans together in the spirit of solidarity and proportionally to their economic potential. However Russia undertook to pay back all Soviet debts and delivered on this promise by completing this process in 2017. In exchange for that the newly independent states had to hand over to Russia part of the Soviet foreign assets. An agreement to this effect was reached with Ukraine in December 1994. However Kiev failed to ratify these agreements and later simply refused to honour them by making demands for a share of the Diamond Treasury gold reserves as well as former USSR property and other assets abroad. Nevertheless despite all these challenges Russia always worked with Ukraine in an open and honest manner and as I have already said with respect for its interests. We developed our ties in multiple fields. Thus in 2011 bilateral trade exceeded $50 billion. Let me note that in 2019 that is before the pandemic Ukraine’s trade with all EU countries combined was below this indicator. At the same time it was striking how the Ukrainian authorities always preferred dealing with Russia in a way that ensured that they enjoy all the rights and privileges while remaining free from any obligations. The officials in Kiev replaced partnership with a parasitic attitude acting at times in an extremely brash manner. Suffice it to recall the continuous blackmail on energy transits and the fact that they literally stole gas. I can add that Kiev tried to use dialogue with Russia as a bargaining chip in its relations with the West using the threat of closer ties with Russia for blackmailing the West to secure preferences by claiming that otherwise Russia would have a bigger influence in Ukraine. At the same time the Ukrainian authorities – I would like to emphasise this – began by building their statehood on the negation of everything that united us trying to distort the mentality and historical memory of millions of people of entire generations living in Ukraine. It is not surprising that Ukrainian society was faced with the rise of far-right nationalism which rapidly developed into aggressive Russophobia and neo-Nazism. This resulted in the participation of Ukrainian nationalists and neo-Nazis in the terrorist groups in the North Caucasus and the increasingly loud territorial claims to Russia. A role in this was played by external forces which used a ramified network of NGOs and special services to nurture their clients in Ukraine and to bring their representatives to the seats of authority. It should be noted that Ukraine actually never had stable traditions of real statehood. And therefore in 1991 it opted for mindlessly emulating foreign models which have no relation to history or Ukrainian realities. Political government institutions were readjusted many times to the rapidly growing clans and their self-serving interests which had nothing to do with the interests of the Ukrainian people. Essentially the so-called pro-Western civilisational choice made by the oligarchic Ukrainian authorities was not and is not aimed at creating better conditions in the interests of people’s well-being but at keeping the billions of dollars that the oligarchs have stolen from the Ukrainians and are holding in their accounts in Western banks while reverently accommodating the geopolitical rivals of Russia. Some industrial and financial groups and the parties and politicians on their payroll relied on the nationalists and radicals from the very beginning. Others claimed to be in favour of good relations with Russia and cultural and language diversity coming to power with the help of their citizens who sincerely supported their declared aspirations including the millions of people in the south-eastern regions. But after getting the positions they coveted these people immediately betrayed their voters going back on their election promises and instead steering a policy prompted by the radicals and sometimes even persecuting their former allies – the public organisations that supported bilingualism and cooperation with Russia. These people took advantage of the fact that their voters were mostly law-abiding citizens with moderate views who trusted the authorities and that unlike the radicals they would not act aggressively or make use of illegal instruments.Meanwhile the radicals became increasingly brazen in their actions and made more demands every year. They found it easy to force their will on the weak authorities which were infected with the virus of nationalism and corruption as well and which artfully replaced the real cultural economic and social interests of the people and Ukraine’s true sovereignty with various ethnic speculations and formal ethnic attributes. A stable statehood has never developed in Ukraine; its electoral and other political procedures just serve as a cover a screen for the redistribution of power and property between various oligarchic clans. Corruption which is certainly a challenge and a problem for many countries including Russia has gone beyond the usual scope in Ukraine. It has literally permeated and corroded Ukrainian statehood the entire system and all branches of power. Radical nationalists took advantage of the justified public discontent and saddled the Maidan protest escalating it to a coup d'état in 2014. They also had direct assistance from foreign states. According to reports the US Embassy provided $1 million a day to support the so-called protest camp on Independence Square in Kiev. In addition large amounts were impudently transferred directly to the opposition leaders’ bank accounts tens of millions of dollars. But the people who actually suffered the families of those who died in the clashes provoked in the streets and squares of Kiev and other cities how much did they get in the end? Better not ask. The nationalists who have seized power have unleashed a persecution a real terror campaign against those who opposed their anti-constitutional actions. Politicians journalists and public activists were harassed and publicly humiliated. A wave of violence swept Ukrainian cities including a series of high-profile and unpunished murders. One shudders at the memories of the terrible tragedy in Odessa where peaceful protesters were brutally murdered burned alive in the House of Trade Unions. The criminals who committed that atrocity have never been punished and no one is even looking for them. But we know their names and we will do everything to punish them find them and bring them to justice. Maidan did not bring Ukraine any closer to democracy and progress. Having accomplished a coup d'état the nationalists and those political forces that supported them eventually led Ukraine into an impasse pushed the country into the abyss of civil war. Eight years later the country is split. Ukraine is struggling with an acute socioeconomic crisis. According to international organisations in 2019 almost 6 million Ukrainians – I emphasise – about 15 percent not of the wokrforce but of the entire population of that country had to go abroad to find work. Most of them do odd jobs. The following fact is also revealing: since 2020 over 60000 doctors and other health workers have left the country amid the pandemic. Since 2014 water bills increased by almost a third and energy bills grew several times while the price of gas for households surged several dozen times. Many people simply do not have the money to pay for utilities. They literally struggle to survive. What happened? Why is this all happening? The answer is obvious. They spent and embezzled the legacy inherited not only from the Soviet era but also from the Russian Empire. They lost tens hundreds of thousands of jobs which enabled people to earn a reliable income and generate tax revenue among other things thanks to close cooperation with Russia. Sectors including machine building instrument engineering electronics ship and aircraft building have been undermined or destroyed altogether. There was a time however when not only Ukraine but the entire Soviet Union took pride in these companies. In 2021 the Black Sea Shipyard in Nikolayev went out of business. Its first docks date back to Catherine the Great. Antonov the famous manufacturer has not made a single commercial aircraft since 2016 while Yuzhmash a factory specialising in missile and space equipment is nearly bankrupt. The Kremenchug Steel Plant is in a similar situation. This sad list goes on and on. As for the gas transportation system it was built in its entirety by the Soviet Union and it has now deteriorated to an extent that using it creates major risks and comes at a high cost for the environment. This situation begs the question: poverty lack of opportunity and lost industrial and technological potential – is this the pro-Western civilisational choice they have been using for many years to fool millions of people with promises of heavenly pastures? It all came down to a Ukrainian economy in tatters and an outright pillage of the country’s citizens while Ukraine itself was placed under external control directed not only from the Western capitals but also on the ground as the saying goes through an entire network of foreign advisors NGOs and other institutions present in Ukraine. They have a direct bearing on all the key appointments and dismissals and on all branches of power at all levels from the central government down to municipalities as well as on state-owned companies and corporations including Naftogaz Ukrenergo Ukrainian Railways Ukroboronprom Ukrposhta and the Ukrainian Sea Ports Authority. There is no independent judiciary in Ukraine. The Kiev authorities at the West’s demand delegated the priority right to select members of the supreme judicial bodies the Council of Justice and the High Qualifications Commission of Judges to international organisations. In addition the United States directly controls the National Agency on Corruption Prevention the National Anti-Corruption Bureau the Specialised Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's Office and the High Anti-Corruption Court. All this is done under the noble pretext of invigorating efforts against corruption. All right but where are the results? Corruption is flourishing like never before. Are the Ukrainian people aware that this is how their country is managed? Do they realise that their country has turned not even into a political or economic protectorate but has been reduced to a colony with a puppet regime? The state was privatised. As a result the government which designates itself as the “power of patriots” no longer acts in a national capacity and consistently pushes Ukraine towards losing its sovereignty. The policy to root out the Russian language and culture and promote assimilation carries on. The Verkhovna Rada has generated a steady flow of discriminatory bills and the law on the so-called indigenous people has already come into force. People who identify as Russians and want to preserve their identity language and culture are getting the signal that they are not wanted in Ukraine. Under the laws on education and the Ukrainian language as a state language the Russian language has no place in schools or public spaces even in ordinary shops. The law on the so-called vetting of officials and purging their ranks created a pathway for dealing with unwanted civil servants. There are more and more acts enabling the Ukrainian military and law enforcement agencies to crack down on the freedom of speech dissent and going after the opposition. The world knows the deplorable practice of imposing unilateral illegitimate sanctions against other countries foreign individuals and legal entities. Ukraine has outperformed its Western masters by inventing sanctions against its own citizens companies television channels other media outlets and even members of parliament. Kiev continues to prepare the destruction of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate. This is not an emotional judgement; proof of this can be found in concrete decisions and documents. The Ukrainian authorities have cynically turned the tragedy of the schism into an instrument of state policy. The current authorities do not react to the Ukrainian people’s appeals to abolish the laws that are infringing on believers’ rights. Moreover new draft laws directed against the clergy and millions of parishioners of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate have been registered in the Verkhovna Rada. A few words about Crimea. The people of the peninsula freely made their choice to be with Russia. The Kiev authorities cannot challenge the clearly stated choice of the people which is why they have opted for aggressive action for activating extremist cells including radical Islamist organisations for sending subversives to stage terrorist attacks at critical infrastructure facilities and for kidnapping Russian citizens. We have factual proof that such aggressive actions are being taken with support from Western security services. In March 2021 a new Military Strategy was adopted in Ukraine. This document is almost entirely dedicated to confrontation with Russia and sets the goal of involving foreign states in a conflict with our country. The strategy stipulates the organisation of what can be described as a terrorist underground movement in Russia’s Crimea and in Donbass. It also sets out the contours of a potential war which should end according to the Kiev strategists “with the assistance of the international community on favourable terms for Ukraine” as well as – listen carefully please – “with foreign military support in the geopolitical confrontation with the Russian Federation.” In fact this is nothing other than preparation for hostilities against our country Russia. As we know it has already been stated today that Ukraine intends to create its own nuclear weapons and this is not just bragging. Ukraine has the nuclear technologies created back in the Soviet times and delivery vehicles for such weapons including aircraft as well as the Soviet-designed Tochka-U precision tactical missiles with a range of over 100 kilometres. But they can do more; it is only a matter of time. They have had the groundwork for this since the Soviet era. In other words acquiring tactical nuclear weapons will be much easier for Ukraine than for some other states I am not going to mention here which are conducting such research especially if Kiev receives foreign technological support. We cannot rule this out either. If Ukraine acquires weapons of mass destruction the situation in the world and in Europe will drastically change especially for us for Russia. We cannot but react to this real danger all the more so since let me repeat Ukraine’s Western patrons may help it acquire these weapons to create yet another threat to our country. We are seeing how persistently the Kiev regime is being pumped with arms. Since 2014 the United States alone has spent billions of dollars for this purpose including supplies of arms and equipment and training of specialists. In the last few months there has been a constant flow of Western weapons to Ukraine ostentatiously with the entire world watching. Foreign advisors supervise the activities of Ukraine’s armed forces and special services and we are well aware of this. Over the past few years military contingents of NATO countries have been almost constantly present on Ukrainian territory under the pretext of exercises. The Ukrainian troop control system has already been integrated into NATO. This means that NATO headquarters can issue direct commands to the Ukrainian armed forces even to their separate units and squads. The United States and NATO have started an impudent development of Ukrainian territory as a theatre of potential military operations. Their regular joint exercises are obviously anti-Russian. Last year alone over 23000 troops and more than a thousand units of hardware were involved. A law has already been adopted that allows foreign troops to come to Ukraine in 2022 to take part in multinational drills. Understandably these are primarily NATO troops. This year at least ten of these joint drills are planned. Obviously such undertakings are designed to be a cover-up for a rapid buildup of the NATO military group on Ukrainian territory. This is all the more so since the network of airfields upgraded with US help in Borispol Ivano-Frankovsk Chuguyev and Odessa to name a few is capable of transferring army units in a very short time. Ukraine’s airspace is open to flights by US strategic and reconnaissance aircraft and drones that conduct surveillance over Russian territory. I will add that the US-built Maritime Operations Centre in Ochakov makes it possible to support activity by NATO warships including the use of precision weapons against the Russian Black Sea Fleet and our infrastructure on the entire Black Sea Coast. At one time the United States intended to build similar facilities in Crimea as well but the Crimeans and residents of Sevastopol wrecked these plans. We will always remember this. I would like to repeat that today such a centre has already been deployed in Ochakov. In the 18th century soldiers of Alexander Suvorov fought for this city. Owing to their courage it became part of Russia. Also in the 18th century the lands of the Black Sea littoral incorporated in Russia as a result of wars with the Ottoman Empire were given the name of Novorossiya (New Russia). Now attempts are being made to condemn these landmarks of history to oblivion along with the names of state and military figures of the Russian Empire without whose efforts modern Ukraine would not have many big cities or even access to the Black Sea. A monument to Alexander Suvorov was recently demolished in Poltava. What is there to say? Are you renouncing your own past? The so-called colonial heritage of the Russian Empire? Well in this case be consistent. Next notably Article 17 of the Constitution of Ukraine stipulates that deploying foreign military bases on its territory is illegal. However as it turns out this is just a conventionality that can be easily circumvented. Ukraine is home to NATO training missions which are in fact foreign military bases. They just called a base a mission and were done with it. Kiev has long proclaimed a strategic course on joining NATO. Indeed each country is entitled to pick its own security system and enter into military alliances. There would be no problem with that if it were not for one “but.” International documents expressly stipulate the principle of equal and indivisible security which includes obligations not to strengthen one's own security at the expense of the security of other states. This is stated in the 1999 OSCE Charter for European Security adopted in Istanbul and the 2010 OSCE Astana Declaration. In other words the choice of pathways towards ensuring security should not pose a threat to other states whereas Ukraine joining NATO is a direct threat to Russia's security. Let me remind you that at the Bucharest NATO summit held in April 2008 the United States pushed through a decision to the effect that Ukraine and by the way Georgia would become NATO members. Many European allies of the United States were well aware of the risks associated with this prospect already then but were forced to put up with the will of their senior partner. The Americans simply used them to carry out a clearly anti-Russian policy.,Pro-Russian,Multiple,Speech"
